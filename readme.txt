#### SAP Fiori Worklist Application Template ####

This is your copy of the "SAP Fiori Worklist Application" template - ready for your custom developments!
You can find the template version in your workspace in the manifest.json file under "sourceTemplate".


This app can be deployed standalone or registered to an SAP Fiori Launchpad depending on the selection you initially
made in the template wizard. All entry points (*.html) can be located via the test.html file in the test folder or the
respective SAP Web IDE run configurations.

SAP Web IDE templates are kept up to date with the latest best practices and recommendations, but they are not updated
automatically! To migrate to a newer version of the template, re-create the template and copy over the changes as needed.

Please report reproducible bugs concerning the template coding itself by creating a BCP ticket for the component CA-UI5-FST.
If the coding issues are not template-related, please choose the appropriate application component.

For more information and documentation of all template features, please refer to the SAPUI5 Demo Kit:
